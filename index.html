    <p>The film's story was written by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad, 
        who randomly told him a story about Sivagami, a woman who carries a baby 
        in her hand while crossing a river, and a few years later about Kattappa,
         which intrigued Rajamouli. His fascination with Mahabharata and the tales 
         of Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama further fuelled his interest in the story.</p>
